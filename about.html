Copy the URLs of the active, selected or all tabs as HTML anchor segments aka. Links (like MS Edge) 
- only better since edge can not copy multiple at the same time - or just as plain old text strings

<b>Usages:</b>
<ul>
        <li>Click on the toolbar icon</li>
        <li>(optional) Set a custom shortcut key for the 4 copy actions</li>
</ul>
